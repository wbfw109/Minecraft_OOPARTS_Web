Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end library for designing websites and web applications.
    // https://getbootstrap.com/
    Bootstrap for responsive layout that accommodates mobile form factors.
    It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions.
    Unlike many web frameworks, it concerns itself with front-end development only.
        Front-end web development is the practice of converting data to graphical interface for user to view and interact with data through digital interaction using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

    ★ Look Version ! Compatible
        
    ★ bootstrap.css VS bootstrap.min.css        (also .js, this .css require script)
        bootstrap.min.css has been minified. This means all the whitespace and other extra characters have been removed.
        This is commonly done for use in production, to reduce the size of the file.
        When developing, it is usually helpful to use the unminified version, since, as you said, it is readable.
    - navbar (navigation bar)
    - Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system.
        Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system.
        Choose from a responsive, fixed-width container (meaning its max-width changes at each breakpoint) or fluid-width (meaning it’s 100% wide all the time).
    - navbar-header
        The navbar-header is mostly an architectural class for Bootstrap navbar.
        It allocates approximately 150px to the left of the navbar to wrap the navbar-brand and allow the brand name or logo to make use of the entire area on click or hover.

modernizr.js (모더나이저)
    It’s a collection of superfast tests – or “detects” as we like to call them – which run as your web page loads,
        then you can use the results to tailor the experience to the user.
    Modernizr란 사용자의 브라우저가 현재 가지고 있는 HTML5, CSS 기능들을 감지하고 지원여부를 판별하는 Javascript 라이브러리 입니다.
        다양한 브라우저에서 지원되는 기능을 하나씩 확인해가면서 개발하는 것은 현실적으로 불가능하기 때문에 Modernizr와 같은 라이브러리를 통해 필요기능을 감지하고 지원 여부에 따라 개발자가 동적으로 처리를 달리할 수 있습니다.
        
respond.js
    A fast & lightweight polyfill for min/max-width CSS3 Media Queries (for IE 6-8, and more)
        Media queries is a CSS3 module allowing content rendering to adapt to conditions such as screen resolution (e.g. smartphone screen vs. computer screen).
        It became a W3C recommended standard in June 2012, and is a cornerstone technology of responsive web design (RWD).
JQuery (Java script library)
    JQuery is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. It is free, 
    pen-source software using the permissive MIT License. Web analysis indicates that it is the most widely deployed JavaScript library by a large margin.

    # is an id selector, used to target a single specific element with a unique id, but . is a class selector used to target multiple elements with a particular class. To put it another way:
        #foo {} will style the single element declared with an attribute id="foo"
        .foo {} will style all elements with an attribute class="foo" (you can have multiple classes assigned to an element too, just separate them with spaces, e.g. class="foo bar")
    절대단위 : in, cm, mm, pt, pc가 있으며 출력장치(모니터)의 물리적 속성을 아는 경우 효율적
    상대단위 : em, ex, px, %가 있으며 기종간, 플랫폼 간의 호환성을 유지하는데 유리

    sr-only
        According to bootstrap's documentation, the class is used to hide information intended only for screen readers from the layout of the rendered page.
        Screen readers will have trouble with your forms if you don't include a label for every input.
        For these inline forms, you can hide the labels using the .sr-only class.

        role= main 은 일부 브라우저를 지원하기 위함

Django
    [settings.py] view.py     →   urls.py   →   *.html
    { { foo }}
        this is a placeholder in the template, for the variable foo that is passed to the template from a view.

    { %  %} 
        when text is surrounded by these delimiters,
        it means that there is some special function or code running, and the result of that will be placed here
        [Ex.]
            forms.py, login.html
            { {form.username }} is variable in forms.py

    django.contrib contains optional, de facto standard implementations of common patterns
        (djang contribution)
    
    Login
        When you submit the form, Django attempts to authenticate the credentials you provide (such as the super user's credentials).
        If authentication fails, you remain on the same page but form.errors set to true.
        If authentication is successful, Django navigates to the relative URL in the "next" field, <input type="hidden" name="next" value="/" />
            ,which in this case is the home page (/).

{% load static %}  VS  {% load staticfiles %}
    Django V1.10 now recommends just {% load static %}.
    "In older versions, you had to use {% load static from staticfiles %} in your template to serve files from the storage defined in STATICFILES_STORAGE.
    This is no longer required."
